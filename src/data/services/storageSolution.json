    "text": "Energy storage solutions refer to technologies and systems that capture and store energy for later use. These solutions play a crucial role in modern energy systems by enabling the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources, improving grid stability, and providing backup power during times of high demand or grid outages. Energy storage solutions can be categorized into several types based on their storage medium and technology. Here are some of the main categories/types of energy storage:",
